# TextServices — Design Decisions & Interaction Log

This file records key design decisions, questions, and responses made during development.
Code-level decisions are in CLAUDE.md. This log covers the *why*.

## 2026-03-29 — Initial design session

### Context
Tom Crane (Digirati) briefed Claude on the requirements via `instructions/text-services.md`.
Claude read both reference implementations in full:
- Wellcome Collection: `C:/git/wellcomecollection/iiif-builder/src/Wellcome.Dds/`
- St Louis Fed: `C:/git/digirati-co-uk/st-louis-fed/src/IIIFBuilder/`

### Questions asked and answers given

**Q1: Root namespace / solution name?**
> "TextServices"

**Q2: Job queue — simple in-process Channel+BackgroundService vs Hangfire vs other?**
> "I am not familiar with Hangfire, but am willing to try it out. I assume that it will work fine in AWS, Azure etc as well as local filesystem?"

*Confirmed: Hangfire uses a pluggable storage backend (PostgreSQL, Redis, SQL Server). Works identically with local PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Just change the connection string.*

**Q3: AutoComplete storage — embedded in Text object (Wellcome pattern) vs separate file (St Louis pattern)?**
> "Let's go for the St Louis separate file pattern - unless you recommend otherwise"

*No counter-recommendation — separate storage is the better design: the Search API can load AutoComplete independently from the (larger) Text object when serving autocomplete-only requests.*

**Q4: IIIF JSON building — use iiif-net NuGet package or plain JSON?**
> "I think keep to simple JSON for now. We might use iiif-net later but I don't think it's necessary right now."

**Q5: MediatR — use it or not?**
> "Use MediatR"

### Additional request
Tom asked for this interaction log to be kept in the repo:
> "is it possible for you to log all of our interactions on this project (not the code churning, just the main interactions and my responses to them) so we have a record"

*This file is the result. It will be updated at the end of each significant working session.*

### Agreed architecture summary
- Three logical components: Core class library, Builder API, Search API
- Five C# projects + two test projects (see CLAUDE.md for full structure)
- protobuf-net serialisation (proven in production in both reference implementations)
- Hangfire + PostgreSQL for durable job queue
- EntityFramework Core + Migrations for job state
- MediatR in both APIs
- Plain `System.Text.Json` for IIIF JSON (no iiif-net for now)
- `ITextFormatProvider` interface for format extensibility (ALTO first, hOCR etc. later)
- ALTO ns-v2 and ns-v3 both supported
- IIIF Search v1 first; v2 phased in later
- Builder API and Search API are separate ASP.NET applications
